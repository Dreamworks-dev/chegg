It was developed by Facebook (now Meta). The action that can be performed by the useEffect can be scanning or fetching the data, timer updating and DOM updating.<br/>useEffect in ReactJS is used to perform some kind of action and this action needs to be performed after the render.<br/><h4>Explanation:</h4><h3>Step 2:</h3>The above error is not a ReactJS error, it is an ESLint warning that is, eslint-plugin-react-hooks.<br/>It informs that such a hook depends on the functions fetchDetails() and sendRequest(). It should be passed as a dependency.<br/>The above error can be fixed using any of the following two ways<br/>(a) If the fetchDetails and sendRequest are not being used anywhere in the code (apart from the useEffect), it can simply be placed inside the useEffect block.<br/>Code will be:<br/>useEffect(() =&gt; {
const fetchDetails = () =&gt; {};
  //your logic in here
const sendRequest = () =&gt; {};
//your logic in here
fetchDetails();
sendRequest();
}, []);<br/><br/>(b) If the fetchDetails and sendRequest are used outside the useEffect block then, deactivating the rule can remove the error<br/>The code will be:<br/>// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps<br/><br/>To fix the missing dependency error, the following code should be followed:<br/>useEffect(() =&gt; {
// code
// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [])<br/><br/><h4>Explanation:</h4>(a) Two arguments are required for the useEffect one is function and the other is dependency (optional). Declaring the function inside the useEffect block will remove the missing dependency error.(c) These two functions are re-created after every render. The next effect is triggered by the render. Memoization can be done to avoid the re-renders. Disabling the react-hooks/exhaustive-deps will avoid the error but it must not be disabled globally and it should be used as a final measure if nothing works.<h2>Final Answer:</h2>When executing the ReactJS program, it shows warning  “React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: ‘fetchDetails'. Either include it or remove the dependency array” or “React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'sendRequest'. Either include it or remove the dependency array”, then add in callback useEffect[id].<br/>{% endblock %}
